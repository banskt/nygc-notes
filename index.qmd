title: "My research journal at the NYGC"
---

Welcome to my journal, where I keep track of my daily work 
and thoughts at the New York Genome Center. 
My primary goals in maintaining this journal are twofold: 
(1) to make my research reproducible and 
(2) to increase my productivity by avoiding repetition
and sharing my work with colleagues.

In these pages, you will find an eclectic (sometimes erratic) mix of my research activities, 
including ideas, equations, code snippets, figures, and more.
Thank you for joining me on this journey of discovery and exploration in genomics research.

I keep track of my daily work at the NYGC using this journal. 
There are two main goals: (1) make my research reproducible,
and (2) become more productive because it helps to avoid repeating,
to remember, and to share with colleagues.

This is an erratic collection of things I do, learn and think.
There may be some ideas, equations, code snippets, figures, etc.
