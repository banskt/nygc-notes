  - GradVI. Discuss figure with Peter on slack.

## 2023-04-17
  
  - GradVI. Simulation complete for linear regression with correlated variables, $r^2 = 0.99$. 
  Run `dscquery` for collecting results. Compare niter between GradVI (compound) and GradVI (direct) and mr.ash.
  Share figure on slack.
  - General Safety and Compliance Orientation

  - [Raj/Knowles joint group meeting](../listen/group-meeting/2023-04-14-adsp-group-meeting.qmd) at ISMMS.
