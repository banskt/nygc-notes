  **Work from Home**

  I read about using Log Bayes Factor as genetic 
  distance between populations to transform the genotype data matrix.
  [Delrieu and Bowman, 2005](https://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/statistics/workshop/lasr2005/Proceedings/bowman.pdf) discuss the mathematical principles.
  [Delrieu and Bowman, 2006](https://doi.org/10.2217/14622416.7.3.311)
  discuss how it can be applied and visualized.
  From the Bayes Factor, they use the scene-anchored argument
  of [Evett and Weir, 1998, "Interpreting DNA Evidence, 
  Statistical Genetics for Forensic Scientists"](https://si.biostat.washington.edu/sites/default/files/modules/Evett_Weir_InterpretingDNAEvidence.pdf)
  to arrive at a statistic which resembles the likelihood ratio.
  For details of derivation, see [Evett and Weir, 1991, "Flawed reasoning in
  court"](https://doi.org/10.1080/09332480.1991.10542339).
