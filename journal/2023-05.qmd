  - The GradVI trendfiltering runtime experiments have failed. 
  Troubleshoot: 40G memory is not enough for the jobs. 
  I removed jobs with $n = (10^5, 10^6)$ and submitted new jobs with 100G 
  of memory in interactive node. 
  The idea is to run the large jobs separately for GradVI.
  - Simulate first order trend filtering data with less memory.
  - How to run GradVI without generating $\mathbf{H}$ matrix?
  I derived equations for obtaining $d_j$ without generating the $\mathbf{H}$ matrix
  and made the required changes in the GradVI software to run without generating
  the matrix. This introduced a bug which prevents running trend filtering for higher orders.
