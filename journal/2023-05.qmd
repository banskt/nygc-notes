  - Make changes and create pull request on DSC for supporting `collections.abc` and rpy2 v3.5.11.
  - Numerical experiments for dense linear regression for correlated variables.
  - Plot results (ELBO, RMSE, runtime) for dense linear regression for correlated variables.
  - Run more replicates for the above simulation.

  - GradVI plots without colors in scatterplot.
  - GradVI runtime-per-iteration plot with $\log_{10}$ scale.
  - Meeting with Matthew. 

## 2023-04-02

  - Run genlasso with large $n$ for one simulation at the NYGC cluster.
  - Onboarding - Health insurance.
  - Genlasso running into out-of-memory error.
  - Make changes in GradVI to run without creating the $\mathbb{H}$ matrix.

  - The GradVI trendfiltering runtime experiments have failed. 
  Troubleshoot: 40G memory is not enough for the jobs. 
  I removed jobs with $n = (10^5, 10^6)$ and submitted new jobs with 100G 
  of memory in interactive node. 
  The idea is to run the large jobs separately for GradVI.
  - Simulate first order trend filtering data with less memory.
  - How to run GradVI without generating $\mathbf{H}$ matrix?
  I derived equations for obtaining $d_j$ without generating the $\mathbf{H}$ matrix
  and made the required changes in the GradVI software to run without generating
  the matrix. This introduced a bug which prevents running trend filtering for higher orders.
