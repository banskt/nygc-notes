title: Setup GradVI workbench
---

Here is a short documentation to setup the environment for running GradVI experiments at the NYGC cluster.

## Install R packages

  - [mr.ash.alpha](https://github.com/stephenslab/mr.ash.alpha)
```R
devtools::install_github("stephenslab/mr.ash.alpha")
```

  - [genlasso](https://github.com/ryantibs/genlasso)
```R
install.packages("genlasso")
```

## Install Python packages

```bash
conda install patsy
```

  - [GradVI](https://github.com/stephenslab/gradvi)
```bash
cd ~/software
git clone git@github.com:stephenslab/gradvi.git
cd gradvi
pip install -e .
```

  - [mr.ash.pen](https://github.com/banskt/mr-ash-pen)
```bash
cd ~/software
git clone git@github.com:banskt/mr-ash-pen.git
cd mr-ash-pen
pip install .
```
I could not install the editable version of the package. I also could not install `fpydemo` using the `-e` flag.
The normal installation was smooth, but the editable version failed while trying to link the same file multiple times.
I ran out of time for debugging, but this needs to be solved later.

## Install DSC

  - Prerequisites that can be installed with conda
```bash
conda install networkx sympy pyarrow sqlalchemy
conda install h5py sos sos-pbs
```

  - Install DSC
```bash
git clone git@github.com:stephenslab/dsc.git
cd dsc
pip install .
```
Output:
```
Successfully built dsc msgpack-python PTable
Installing collected packages: PTable, msgpack-python, numexpr, dsc
Successfully installed PTable-0.9.2 dsc-0.4.3.5 msgpack-python-0.5.6 numexpr-2.8.4
```
  
  - Check installation
```bash
dsc --version
dsc-query --version
```

  - Install R utilities for DSC
```R
setwd("/gpfs/commons/home/sbanerjee/software/dsc/dscrutils")
getwd()
devtools::install_local('.')
system("dsc-query --version")
```
