title: Setup MacOS 
---

Running documentation for the MacOS setup in Janaki.

## Bash

  - Install `bash version 5.2.15(1)` using homebrew following instructions in 
  [this blog post](https://itnext.io/upgrading-bash-on-macos-7138bd1066ba).
  However, I could not create the Symlink by disabling SIP (`csrutil disable`).
  - The pre-installed old bash still exists in `/bin/bash`.
  Therefore, I have to write bash scripts using `#!/usr/bin/env bash`.
  - Update my `dotfiles` for Mac specific utilities.

## Homebrew

  - Why don't they ship this package manager as default in MacOS?

## Terminal

  - The default terminal in Mac does not support 24 bit color,
  and many other Unix features which I use regularly (for example, middle click paste).
  - Install iterm2 using homebrew
  ```
  brew install --cask iterm2
  ```

## Latex

  - I do not want the GUI packages of MacTex, but I want full TexLive.
  - For a finer control over TexLive, I decided to clone the TexLive repository and install from there.
  ```
  brew install wget
  mkdir -p /opt/texlive-repository
  chown -R sbanerjee:staff /opt/texlive-repository
  update-texlive-repository /opt/texlive-repository # this is an alias to clone the repository, takes couple of hours
  ```
  - Finally, install TexLive from the repository

## gcc / gfortran

  - Just install with Homebrew.
  ```
  brew info gcc
  brew install gcc
  ```

## R

  - Requires gfortran, TeX, tcltk 

## Python

## Quarto
