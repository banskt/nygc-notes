Post-install configuration\nI initially considered using custom ports for HTTP and HTTPS (instead of the default 80 and 443) but I rejected the idea because Let’s Encrypt requires port 80 for generating and renewing certificates. These articles also helped in making the decision:\n\nLet’s Encrypt explains why you should keep port 80 open\nScott Helme argues against closing port 80\n\n\n\nnginx.conf\nModify the configuration file for external access. Here is my initial nginx configuration in /opt/nginx/1.24.0/conf/nginx.conf.\nuser  minion;\nworker_processes  1;\n\nevents {\n    worker_connections  1024;\n}\n\n\nhttp {\n    include       mime.types;\n    default_type  application/octet-stream;\n\n    sendfile        on;\n    keepalive_timeout  65;\n\n    server {\n        listen       80;\n        server_name  127.0.0.1 &lt;ipv4_address&gt;;\n        location / {\n            root   html;\n            index  index.html index.htm;\n        }\n        # redirect server error pages to the static page /50x.html\n        error_page   500 502 503 504  /50x.html;\n        location = /50x.html {\n            root   html;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\nOpen port in firewall\nTo register nginx as an ufw application, create a file /etc/ufw/applications.d/nginx. Replace xx with port numbers for HTTP and HTTPS. If you are running nginx as a non-root user, then you have to change the accessible port because the default port 80 is not available to non-root users. Therefore, it’s necessary to use a port &gt; 1000.\n[Nginx HTTP]\ntitle=Web Server (Nginx, HTTP)\ndescription=Small, but very powerful and efficient web server\nports=80/tcp\n\n[Nginx HTTPS]\ntitle=Web Server (Nginx, HTTPS)\ndescription=Small, but very powerful and efficient web server\nports=443/tcp\n\n[Nginx Full]\ntitle=Web Server (Nginx, HTTP + HTTPS)\ndescription=Small, but very powerful and efficient web server\nports=80,443/tcp\nCheck the registered app and allow nginx HTTP.\nsudo ufw app info 'Nginx HTTP'\nsudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTP'\nLog files should be accessible by the user minion.\nchown -R root:minion /opt/nginx/1.24.0/logs\nchown minion:minion /opt/nginx/1.24.0/logs/access.log\nchown minion:minion /opt/nginx/1.24.0/logs/error.log\nchmod 775 /opt/nginx/1.24.0/logs\n\n\nUseful commands\nCheck nginx configuration and start nginx.\n# check configuration\nsudo /opt/nginx/1.24.0/sbin/nginx -t\n# start\nsudo /opt/nginx/1.24.0/sbin/nginx\n# stop\nsudo /opt/nginx/1.24.0/sbin/nginx -s stop\n# restart\nsudo /opt/nginx/1.24.0/sbin/nginx -s reload\n\n\nsystemd\nCreate a systemd service file to control nginx using systemctl as described in the official documentation. In Ubuntu 22.04, the file is /lib/systemd/system/nginx.service.\n[Unit]\nDescription=The NGINX HTTP and reverse proxy server\nAfter=syslog.target network-online.target remote-fs.target nss-lookup.target\nWants=network-online.target\n\n[Service]\nType=forking\nPIDFile=/opt/nginx/1.24.0/logs/nginx.pid\nExecStartPre=/opt/nginx/1.24.0/sbin/nginx -t\nExecStart=/opt/nginx/1.24.0/sbin/nginx\nExecReload=/opt/nginx/1.24.0/sbin/nginx -s reload\nExecStop=/bin/kill -s QUIT $MAINPID\nPrivateTmp=true\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\nNow, I can use systemctl commands to control nginx.\nsudo systemctl status nginx\nsudo systemctl start nginx\nsudo systemctl stop nginx\nsudo systemctl restart nginx\n\n\nCheck\nFire up the browser and check both links:\n\nhttp://127.0.0.1\nhttp://&lt;ipv4_address&gt;\n\nIf you are installing on the server and you do not have access to the localhost (127.0.0.1) of the remote server, then you can ssh-tunnel to the remote server from your local machine. For example, I defined ashwini in ssh/config of the local machine and installed ssh-localportfwd from here.\nssh-localportfwd open ashwini 80 &lt;local_port&gt;\nThen, I can access the localhost of the remote machine using http://127.0.0.1:xx where xx is the local_port of my local machine through which I tunneled. The second IPv4 address should work from external network.\nThe SSL connection will still not work. Do not worry yet.\n\n\nModular control\nOnce everything was working, I removed the external IP from the base configuration of nginx and created server configurations in ~/local/etc/nginx/sites-available/ For example, here is my 000-default-server.conf:\nserver {\n    listen      80 default_server;\n    server_name &lt;ipv4_address&gt;;\n    location / {\n        root        /path/to/webdata/base;\n        index       index.html index.htm;\n    }\n    # redirect server error pages to the static page /50x.html\n    error_page   500 502 503 504  /50x.html;\n    location = /50x.html {\n        root        /path/to/webdata/base;\n    }\n\n    # produce a directory listing using ngx_http_autoindex_module \n    autoindex            on;\n    autoindex_exact_size off;\n    autoindex_localtime  on;\n\n    # Deny access to anything starting with .ht\n    location ~ /\\.ht {\n        deny  all;\n    }\n}\nI added the following line to /opt/nginx/1.24.0/conf/nginx.conf:\ninclude /home/banskt/local/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*\nAnd then created the sites-enabled directory:\nmkdir -p ~/local/etc/nginx/sites-enabled\ncd ~/local/etc/nginx/sites-enabled\nln -s /home/banskt/local/etc/nginx/sites-available/000-default-server.conf ./default\nThis way, I can manage adding domains, sub-domains, sub-directories on my server directly from my sites-available and sites-enabled directories.\nAt this point, 127.0.0.1 should serve the nginx welcome message and &lt;ipv4_address&gt; should serve the HTML files from /path/to/webdata/base. Again, check they are working with ssh-localportfwd.\n\n\n\nLink domain name\nI had purchased several domain names. Now, it is time to put one of them to use. You can skip this step and access the server using IPv4 address instead.\n\nLogin to namesilo.com\nManage DNS\nUse default nameservers of namesilo.com\nChange A record pointing to the VPS IPv4 address. You can point different subdomains to different IP addresses. If you want to point every subdomain to the same IP, you can use an asterisk (*) as your subdomain.\nUpdate nginx.conf, change IPv4 address to mydomain.com.\n\n\nAlias www to non-www\nI want to redirect all traffic from www to non-www. Easiest way is to define an A entry for www.mydomain.com and use 301 redirect from nginx configuration. However, when my IP changes then I have to change the A record for both mydomain.com and www.mydomain.com. Another solution is to use CNAME entry in the DNS zone file and redirect in the server nginx configuration. Both of them are required as explained in this Stackoverflow answer.\n\nA CNAME record does not function the same way as a URL redirect. A CNAME record directs web traffic for a particular domain to the target domain’s IP address. Once the visitor reaches that IP address, the web server’s configuration will determine how the domain is handled. If that domain is not configured on the server, the server will simply display its default web page (if any). This may or may not be the web page for the target domain in the CNAME record, depending on how the server is configured.\n\n\nAdd CNAME entry in zonefile.\nAdd 301 redirect in nginx.conf\n\nserver {\n    listen      80;\n    server_name www.mydomain.com;\n    return 301 $scheme://mydomain.com$request_uri;\n}\n\n\nCheck DNS\nThere are many DNS lookups, but I like intoDNS.\n\n\n\nSSL\nI did not use certbot because it enforced installation using snap.\n\nInstall acme. The options used for the installation are explained in the documentation.\n\ngit clone https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh.git\ncd acme.sh/\n./acme.sh --install --home /home/banskt/local/apps/acme --accountemail banskt.saikat@gmail.com\nDelete the entry in ~/.bashrc and add it to ~/.custom_dotfiles/bashrc.\n# Source acme.sh for SSL certificates\nsource \"/home/banskt/local/apps/acme/acme.sh.env\"\nAfter sourcing, acme.sh will be available on commandline. Check.\n\nCreate the acme-challenge directory in the document root.\n\ncd /path/to/webdata/base\nmkdir -p .well-known/acme-challenge/\nsudo chown -R minion:minion .well-known\nsudo chmod -R 770 .well-known\nand give permissions according to your setup.\n\nCreate directory to store SSL certificates\n\ncd /home/banskt/local/etc/nginx/\nmkdir -p ssl/mydomain.com/\n\nGenerate dhparams file\n\ncd /home/banskt/local/etc/nginx/ssl/\nmodule load openssl/3.1.3\nopenssl dhparam -out dhparams.pem 4096\n\nIssue certificates. Optionally, use DNS API. You can either issue certificate for a single domain,\n\nacme.sh --issue -d foo.mydomain.com -w /path/to/webdata/base -k 4096\nor have multiple domains in the same certificate.\nacme.sh --issue -d mydomain.com -d www.mydomain.com -w /path/to/webdata/base -k 4096\nHere, -w specifies the document root of the website where the acme-challenge is created, -k specifies the domain key length.\n\nGenerate SSL configurations from Mozilla SSL Configuration Generator. Write the configuration in /opt/nginx/1.24.0/conf/ssl_params.conf so that it can be included for all servers. Remember to update your DNS resolver from /etc/resolv.conf. For each server, create the SSL nginx configuration, for example,\n\n  ssl_certificate         /home/banskt/local/etc/nginx/ssl/sbanerjee.in/fullchain.pem;\n  ssl_certificate_key     /home/banskt/local/etc/nginx/ssl/sbanerjee.in/privkey.pem;\n  # verify chain of trust of OCSP response using Root CA and Intermediate certs\n  ssl_trusted_certificate /home/banskt/local/etc/nginx/ssl/sbanerjee.in/fullchain.pem;\n  include                 /opt/nginx/1.24.0/conf/ssl_params.conf;\n\nInstall the issued certificate to nginx server\n\nacme.sh --install-cert -d mydomain.com \\\n        --fullchain-file /home/banskt/local/etc/nginx/ssl/mydomain.com/fullchain.pem \\\n        --key-file       /home/banskt/local/etc/nginx/ssl/mydomain.com/privkey.pem \\\n        --reloadcmd \"\"\n#\nacme.sh --install-cert -d foo.mydomain.com \\\n        --fullchain-file /home/banskt/local/etc/nginx/ssl/foo.mydomain.com/fullchain.pem \\\n        --key-file       /home/banskt/local/etc/nginx/ssl/foo.mydomain.com/privkey.pem \\\n        --reloadcmd \"sudo systemctl restart nginx\"\n\nCheck everything is working! Use browser and Qualys SSL server test.\n\nacme.sh --help\nacme.sh --list\n\n\nImprove speed and performance\n\nTuning nginx can improve speed and performance.\nBetter SSL configuration\nLet’s Encrypt without port 80\nnginx full example config\n\nI modified my nginx.conf to improve speed, performance and security.\nI also setup custom locations for the worker process in home/banskt/local/etc/nginx and setup proper access.\nmkdir -p /home/banskt/local/etc/nginx/worker\nsudo chown -R minion:minion /home/banskt/local/etc/nginx/worker\n# use ssh port to login for user minion\nssh minion@localhost -p xxxxx \ncd /home/banskt/local/etc/nginx\nsudo mkdir worker && cd worker\nmkdir client_body fastcgi uwscgi scgi proxy logs\nchmod -R 700 client_body/ fastcgi/ proxy/ scgi/ uwscgi/\ncd logs\ntouch access.log error.log\nchmod 644 access.log error.log\ncd ..\n# exit and change owner of logs to root\nexit\nsudo chown -R root:minion /home/banskt/local/etc/nginx/worker/logs\nSpecify the new directories in nginx.conf and /lib/systemd/system/nginx.service. The PID file location must be same in both. After changing systemd file, we need to reload daemon.\nsudo systemctl stop nginx\nsudo systemctl daemon-reload\nsudo systemctl reset-failed\nsudo systemctl start nginx\nBug: nginx -t still tries to open the default error log file with which it was compiled. It throws an alert if it does not find the file. I do not like alerts. Therefore, I created a dummy file at the compilation location.\nUpdate: My nginx configuration files are now backed up here.\n\n\nInstall MySQL\nInstalling MySQL from source is mildly convoluted and risk non-optimal settings leading to reduced functionality, performance, or security (see here).

    "text": "OTTERS: a powerful TWAS framework leveraging summary-level reference data\n\nPresented by Teresa Lin\nTraditional TWAS works in three steps: (1) learn from eQTL data, (2) predict gene expression on GWAS data, (3) find association between predicted gene expression and the trait. The main idea of OTTERS is to perform step 1 with eQTL summary statistics. They use difference PRS methods.\n\n\n\nOTTERS\n\n\nWe develop a TWAS framework called OTTERS (Omnibus Transcriptome Test using Expression Reference Summary data) that adapts multiple polygenic risk score (PRS) methods to estimate eQTL weights from summary-level eQTL reference data and conducts an omnibus TWAS.",

One potential source of error could be because ROSMAP samples are reverse-stranded.\nThey are planning to extend to trans-eQTLs.\nLink\nChirag asked about isoform TWAS.\n\n\n\nImpact of genetic variants on TF binding and chromatin in AD in cell-type specific ways.\nGWAS identified 75+ AD associated genetic loci. Myeloid cells are important.\nAD risk loci mediated by gene expression in microglia. MiGA (Microglia Genomic Atlas). Paiva Lopes, … Raj, Nat Genet.\ncaQTLs - chromatin accessibility.\nbQTLs - TF binding QTLs, from novel pooled ChIP-Seq.\nHarmonize bulk, sorted and single-cell/nuclei ATAC-seq datasets from neuronal and non-neuronal cells, enriching for myeloid cells, create chromatin accesibility profiles. About 1063 total donors bulk, 179 total donors in single nuclei.\nHow myeloid chromatin states compare to other cell types?\nGeschwind lab - ATAC-seq bulk - fetal brains, PHNPC cell types, 92 donors - NPD\nMonocytes are good proxy for microglia.\nsnMultiomics - RNA, ATAC. Also genotyped.\n\n\n\nEvolutionary conservation of alternative splicing. Generally AS is quite species specific. Mazin et al, Nat Genet. 2021 showed three cassette exons in DLG3 that are highly conserved AS events in the brain. But, we know little about splicing conservation in single cells.\nHow well can we measure AS in single cell? Olivieri et al, eLife 2021, Hardwick et al, Nat Biotechnol, 2022\nSPLiT-Seq with PolyDT + random hexamer primers provide better coverage than 10X genomics with polyDT primers.\nZooBrain: regulatory conservation across vertebrate brains. Satija group. How to define splicing events from RNA-Seq data?\nAre junction counts zero inflated? 39% of junctions show zero-inflation under a global binomial model. Whereas only ~1% show zero inflation with individual binomial model.\nDo PBMCs undergo differential splicing?\nKarin is also looking at topic-modeling of single-cells.\n\n\n\nAssessing the effect of different variables on gene expression and define appropriate covariates for sQTL analysis.\nsplicing QTLs are variants that modify alternative splicing events. She is using 9 cohorts (n ~ 5.5k).\nFirst 3 PCs of the gene expression explain more than 50% variation. She thinks that cohort and tissue types are the major driver of the variation. Needs to be accounted for in the sQTL analysis. She also checked for library preparation as a possible covariate, she checked for number of reads and sex as covariates.\nCan we try using any unsupervised method for predicting the hidden covariates?\nIdentify a good approach to account for covariate effects while performing sQTL analysis.\n\n\n\nImproving rare variant association tests using functional annotations.\nShe talked about Functional Score Test (FST). We expect the FST to capture the signature of functional annotation The FST does not appear to be capturing the difference between known AD genes and random genes. Also see my notes on her group meeting earlier this week.\n\n\n\nWhy microglia? Involved in A\\(\\beta\\) plaque formation.\nThe project aims to contruct prediction model. Training: Brain (microglia) RNA-Seq. Learn DL model and then predict.\nPangolin - improving multiple tissue prediction by combining different species. It is trained on 4 species, human rhesus, mouse and rat. 10,000 base pair sequence context, dilated residual convolution layers, and predict splice probability. Pangolin outperforms SpliceAI.\n\n\n\nPangolin\n\n\nTatsuhiko showed the pipeline for generating training and test data for Pangolin. Essentially, the idea is to find the splice sites and find association with reference genome. He will use microglia data from other species, published elsewhere recently. He discussed a detailed benchmarking plan for comparison of his new microglia data training with the origin training. The expectation is to improve accuracy with increasing sample size and species.\n\n\n\nA-to-I RNA editing is abundant in the brain and implicated in disease.\n\n\n\nRNA editing\n\n\n\n\nn = 11801 (!)\nMethods - RNA editing events called with Jacusa2. edQTL mapping with TensorQTL.\nMeta-analysis drastically improves discovery revealing 21620 edQTLs in 5866 genes. But, he is observing many “singleton” sites, that is, associations observed in single cohorts. edSites occur in hyper-editing clusters.\nColocalization analysis.\nedQTLs colocalize with Parkinson’s disease risk SNPs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPipeline using Wightman summary stat, QC, functional fine-mapping (PolyFun) and statistical fine-mapping (SuSiE), finally Polygenic Risk Score (Plink with clumping + p threshold).\nTeresa is comparing the accuracy of finemapping by looking at the heritability enrichment obtained from the finemapped variants, as well as using PRS performance of the finemapped variants.\nQuestion: Is the PRS score measured on separate test data?\n\n\n\nMeta-analysis of myeloid cell eQTLs.\nUse the myeloid cells from the BigBrain project.\nMany eQTLs colocalize with AD GWAS loci.\nHe wants to develop framework to understand enrichment for eQTL (and sQTL) data. - Approach 1: fine map and use results as continuous annotation, assess heritability via LD score regression. - Approach 2: run mediated expression score regression (MESC).",

David told that the rank of the optimized matrix was not always at the boundary of the \\(\\ell_1\\) ball. He fixed some errors in the R implementation of weighted PCA – step size was incorrect. Variant 1 of step size ($ = 2 / (2 + t)$) is slower than Variant 2 optimum \\(\\gamma\\) obtained by minimizing the function \\(f(\\mathbf{X} - \\gamma \\mathbf{D})\\), where \\(\\mathbf{D} = \\mathbf{X} - \\mathbf{S}\\). Removing duplicate GWAS from IEU helps delineating the clusters in lower dimension. Can we setup simulations to benchmark the methods? Can we use weights to improve results? How to harmonize the weights? Will Niamh be able to help us in harmonizing the GWAS summary statistics?\nSecond project.

Anjali discussed the article, “Adjusting for common variant polygenic scores improves yield in rare variant association analyses”, Jurgens et al, Nature Genetics 55, 544–548 (2023). Link. Using 65 traits from the UK Biobank data, the authors showed that including PGS as a fixed-effect covariate in linear mixed model analysis (using GENESIS) improved the yield and discovery power for rare variant association signal. The authors constructed PGS for each trait based on two different methods: (1) lead-SNP, and (2) PRS-CS, which applies a Bayesian regression framework to identify posterior variant effect sizes based on a continuous shrinkage prior, which is directly learnt from the data\nNPD.

Using \\(F_{ST}\\) statistic, Coop provided quantitative formulation to understand the genetic divergence between two sub-population, for example, after migration.\n\n\n\nTo understand the effect of genetic drift of population structure, imagine a population of constant size of \\(N_e\\) diploid individuals that \\(T\\) generations in the past split into two sub-populations each of size \\(N_e\\) individuals, which do not subsequently exchange migrants. In the current day we sample an equal number of alleles from both subpopulations.\nConsider a pair of alleles sampled within one of our sub-populations and think about their per site heterozygosity. These alleles have experienced a population of size \\(N_e\\) and so the probability that they differ is \\(H_S \\approx 4N_e \\mu\\) (assuming that \\(N_e \\mu \\ll 1\\), using the equation for heterozygosity within a population).\nAssume equal sampling from both sub-populations, total heterozygosity is given by,\n\\[\nH_T = 0.5 H_S + 0.5 H_B\n\\] where \\(H_B\\) is the probability that a pair of alleles drawn from the two different sub-populations differ from each other.

Although it is counter-intuitive at first, Gingerich (1983) gives two reasons as to why this could happen:\n\nOrganisms differing by a factor of much more (or less) than 1.2 are so different (or so similar) that they are rarely compared in calculating rates, regardless of the time available. (Meaning, high change rate over long time will be systematically ignored.)\nRates are based on net change between initial and final states. A period of rapid change followed by a period of stasis will yield a rate of intermediate value for the entire interval. Similarly, a period of rapid change in one direction followed by a period of reversal will yield a low net rate. The shorter the interval of measurement, the more likely one is to observe high rates. The longer the interval, the more stasis and evolutionary reversal are likely to be averaged in the result. This effect systematically damps the values of rates calculated over longer and longer intervals.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "“The little things are infinitely the most important.” – Sherlock Holmes.\nClinical, epidemiological and genetic studies often seek to understand the “risk factors” for diseases. In this pursuit, we often encounter terms which have important distinctions, but are sometimes used interchangeably by scientists and clinicians, for example, risks, rates and odds. It is important to understand these distinctions and use the terms in their distinctive context. Here, I seek to define some of these terms.\n\nRisk\nRisk is defined as the number of new cases that occur during a specified time period in a population. It involves only new cases, and individuals must be free from the condition at the start of the time period. It is either expressed as a proportion (divided by the total population) ranging from 0 to 1, or as a percent ranging from 0 to 100. This is also referred to as absolute risk or incidence.\n\n\nPrevalence\nPrevalence is defined as the number of cases existing in a population. A prevalence rate is the total number of cases of a disease existing in a population divided by the total population.\n\n\nExposure (or risk factor)\nAn exposure is an event (treatment, presence or absence of some factors, environmental or genetic makeup, etc), also called a risk factor, that changes the risk of disease.\n\n\nRisk ratio (or relative risk)\nRisk ratio, also called relative risk, often abbreviated as RR, is defined as the ratio of the disease risk \\(r_e\\) among individuals exposed to a certain exposure (or risk factor) to the disease risk \\(r_0\\) among nonexposed individuals.\n\\[\n\\textrm{RR} = \\frac{r_e}{r_0}\n\\]\n\n\nSusceptibility\nSusceptibility (\\(s\\)) is coupled with exposure. In the general context, exposures that lead to excess disease risk are considered to increase disease susceptibility. Susceptibility depends on the underlying model of disease causation and has been defined (or measured) in many different ways depending on the context. Due to lack of an exact definition, I will follow Khoury et. al. (Khoury et al. 1989), who used the simple sufficient cause model to derive the general relation of \\(s\\) to risk. Under this model, we assume some exposure E is part of a sufficient cause for the disease and we denote by \\(s\\) the proportion of individuals who have all other components except E. Thus, \\(s\\) is the proportion of “susceptible” persons who, if exposed, would contract the disease.\nTo derive the general relation of \\(s\\) to risk, we consider two events: 1) the event A that the individual is susceptible (via exposure to E), and 2) the event B that a person has a sufficient cause that does not involve exposure E. The probability of events A and B are related as follows:\n\\[\nP(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B)\n\\]\nWe note that, by definition \\(s = P(A)\\), the risk of exposed is \\(r_e = P(A \\cup B)\\), and the risk of unexposed is \\(r_0 = P(A \\cap B)\\). Combining these, we have,\n\\[\ns = r_e - r_0 + P(A \\cap B)\n\\]\nSince \\(P(A \\cap B) \\ge 0\\) and \\(P(A \\cap B) \\le r_0\\), we have\n\\[\nr_e - r_0 \\le s \\le r_e\n\\]\nIf A and B were independent, then \\(P(A \\cap B) = P(A)P(B)\\) and we would have, \\[\ns_{\\textrm{ind}} = \\frac{r_e - r_0}{1 - r_0}\n\\]\nIt is important to note that the definition (and measure) of susceptibility will change under other disease causation models. The concept of susceptibility helps communicate the risk of developing a disease but does not provide a rigorous definition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhenotypic variance\n\nKhoury, Muin J., W.
