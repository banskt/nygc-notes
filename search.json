    "title": "Chapter 6, Population Genetics by Graham Coop",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The chapter discusses how genetic differentiation build up between closely related population. Using \\(F_{ST}\\) statistic, Coop provided quantitative formulation to understand the genetic divergence between two sub-population, for example, after migration.\n\n\n\nTo understand the effect of genetic drift of population structure, imagine a population of constant size of \\(N_e\\) diploid individuals that \\(T\\) generations in the past split into two sub-populations each of size \\(N_e\\) individuals, which do not subsequently exchange migrants. In the current day we sample an equal number of alleles from both subpopulations.\nConsider a pair of alleles sampled within one of our sub-populations and think about their per site heterozygosity. These alleles have experienced a population of size \\(N_e\\) and so the probability that they differ is \\(H_S \\approx 4N_e \\mu\\) (assuming that \\(N_e \\mu \\ll 1\\), using the equation for heterozygosity within a population).\nAssume equal sampling from both sub-populations, total heterozygosity is given by,\n\\[\nH_T = 0.5 H_S + 0.5 H_B\n\\] where \\(H_B\\) is the probability that a pair of alleles drawn from the two different sub-populations differ from each other. A pair of alleles from different sub-populations cannot find a common ancestor with each other for at least \\(T\\) generations into the past as they are in distinct populations (not connected by migration). Once these alleles find themselves back in the combined ancestral population it takes them on average \\(2N\\) generations to coalesce. So the total opportunity for mutation between the pair of alleles sampled from different populations is \\(2 (T + 2N )\\) generations of meioses, such that the probability that the pairs of alleles is different is \\[\nH_B \\approx 2\\mu ( T + 2 N) %\\left( 1-(1-\\mu)^{2T} \\right) + (1-\\mu)^{2T}\n  %\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta+1}\n\\]\n\\[\nF_{ST} \\approx \\frac{ \\mu T}{\\mu T +  4N_e\\mu }  = \\frac{ T}{ T +  4N_e}\n\\]\n\n\n\nSome other concepts that we discussed include a simple model of migration, incomplete lineage sorting, and testing for gene flow. Summary (from the book):\n\nOnly a small number of migrants between populations per generation is sufficient to prevent the build up of neutral allele frequency differentiation.\nIncomplete lineage sorting of ancestral variation is one source of disagreement between population/species-trees and gene trees. It occurs when the split times between populations are in quick enough succession that lineages do not have time coalese between more closely related populations.\nGene flow can also lead to patterns similar to incomplete lineage sorting. We can test between a model of incomplete lineage sorting and gene flow using tests such as ABBA-BABA."

Here are my notes on the in-person joint meeting.\n\n\n17k WGS, 40 cohorts, mix of ancestry. Find new genes, alleles, etc for AD.\n\nFunctional genomics. xQTL (Gao Wang and Phil de Jager). Multi-omic functional assessment of novel AD variants using single-cell (Montine, Kundaje, Montgomery).\nAI / ML: neuro-imaging. Olivier Lichtarge - cognitive computing of AD genes and risk. Wein Pan - causal and integrative dep learning for AD genetics. Paul Thompson - mega-grant.\nStructural variant WG.\n\n\n\nApply deep learning techniques to predict and interpret the functional effects of AD variants, gene regulation, gene networks (RNA-Seq, ATAC-Seq, cell-type specific), trans-eQTL, prioritization of genes and pathways (finemapping?).\n\n\n\n\nTraining functional genomics models in PyTorch.\nDL models predict functional genomic assays as a function of sequence. DNA -> Convolution Layers -> Dilated convolution layers -> Prediction.\nKelley et al, Genome Research, 2018.\nFor genomics, the goal is two-fold: (1) classification - predict called peaks for a particular assay, (2) regression - predict read counts of that assay.\nBias correction is important. read counts - assay bias. Basenji - GC bias. BPNet - bias correction model. How do this bias correction methods work?\nInput format - one hot encoding of DNA sequence.\nOutput - generate bins of read counts for each functional genomics assay.\nCreate Dataloader - tiled matrix of DNA. Split data for training / validation / test.\n\n\n\nCell-type specific distal genetic regulation.\nGoal: cis and trans eQTLs for a massive resource of uniformly processed RNA-Seq and genotype data (BigBrain) - expression, isoforms and splicing.\nThere are several cohorts and the team has calculated summary statistics for cis-eQTLs in most of them.\nFor one particular cohort, they found very few sQTLs. Is there someting wrong with the ROSMAP cohort? One potential source of error could be because ROSMAP samples are reverse-stranded.\nThey are planning to extend to trans-eQTLs.\nLink\nChirag asked about isoform TWAS.\n\n\n\nImpact of genetic variants on TF binding and chromatin in AD in cell-type specific ways.\nGWAS identified 75+ AD associated genetic loci. Myeloid cells are important.\nAD risk loci mediated by gene expression in microglia. MiGA (Microglia Genomic Atlas). Paiva Lopes, … Raj, Nat Genet.\ncaQTLs - chromatin accessibility.\nbQTLs - TF binding QTLs, from novel pooled ChIP-Seq.\nHarmonize bulk, sorted and single-cell/nuclei ATAC-seq datasets from neuronal and non-neuronal cells, enriching for myeloid cells, create chromatin accesibility profiles. About 1063 total donors bulk, 179 total donors in single nuclei.\nHow myeloid chromatin states compare to other cell types?\nGeschwind lab - ATAC-seq bulk - fetal brains, PHNPC cell types, 92 donors - NPD\nMonocytes are good proxy for microglia.\nsnMultiomics - RNA, ATAC. Also genotyped.\n\n\n\nEvolutionary conservation of alternative splicing. Generally AS is quite species specific. Mazin et al, Nat Genet. 2021 showed three cassette exons in DLG3 that are highly conserved AS events in the brain. But, we know little about splicing conservation in single cells.\nHow well can we measure AS in single cell? Olivieri et al, eLife 2021, Hardwick et al, Nat Biotechnol, 2022\nSPLiT-Seq with PolyDT + random hexamer primers provide better coverage than 10X genomics with polyDT primers.\nZooBrain: regulatory conservation across vertebrate brains. Satija group. How to define splicing events from RNA-Seq data?\nAre junction counts zero inflated? 39% of junctions show zero-inflation under a global binomial model. Whereas only ~1% show zero inflation with individual binomial model.\nDo PBMCs undergo differential splicing?\nKarin is also looking at topic-modeling of single-cells.\n\n\n\nAssessing the effect of different variables on gene expression and define appropriate covariates for sQTL analysis.\nsplicing QTLs are variants that modify alternative splicing events. She is using 9 cohorts (n ~ 5.5k).\nFirst 3 PCs of the gene expression explain more than 50% variation. She thinks that cohort and tissue types are the major driver of the variation. Needs to be accounted for in the sQTL analysis. She also checked for library preparation as a possible covariate, she checked for number of reads and sex as covariates.\nCan we try using any unsupervised method for predicting the hidden covariates?\nIdentify a good approach to account for covariate effects while performing sQTL analysis.\n\n\n\nImproving rare variant association tests using functional annotations.\nShe talked about Functional Score Test (FST). We expect the FST to capture the signature of functional annotation The FST does not appear to be capturing the difference between known AD genes and random genes. Also see my notes on her group meeting earlier this week.\n\n\n\nWhy microglia? Involved in A\\(\\beta\\) plaque formation.\nThe project aims to contruct prediction model. Training: Brain (microglia) RNA-Seq. Learn DL model and then predict.\nPangolin - improving multiple tissue prediction by combining different species. It is trained on 4 species, human rhesus, mouse and rat. 10,000 base pair sequence context, dilated residual convolution layers, and predict splice probability. Pangolin outperforms SpliceAI.\n\n\n\nPangolin\n\n\nTatsuhiko showed the pipeline for generating training and test data for Pangolin. Essentially, the idea is to find the splice sites and find association with reference genome. He will use microglia data from other species, published elsewhere recently. He discussed a detailed benchmarking plan for comparison of his new microglia data training with the origin training. The expectation is to improve accuracy with increasing sample size and species.\n\n\n\nA-to-I RNA editing is abundant in the brain and implicated in disease.\n\n\n\nRNA editing\n\n\n\n\nn = 11801 (!)\nMethods - RNA editing events called with Jacusa2. edQTL mapping with TensorQTL.\nMeta-analysis drastically improves discovery revealing 21620 edQTLs in 5866 genes. But, he is observing many “singleton” sites, that is, associations observed in single cohorts. edSites occur in hyper-editing clusters.\nColocalization analysis.\nedQTLs colocalize with Parkinson’s disease risk SNPs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPipeline using Wightman summary stat, QC, functional fine-mapping (PolyFun) and statistical fine-mapping (SuSiE), finally Polygenic Risk Score (Plink with clumping + p threshold).\nTeresa is comparing the accuracy of finemapping by looking at the heritability enrichment obtained from the finemapped variants, as well as using PRS performance of the finemapped variants.\nQuestion: Is the PRS score measured on separate test data?\n\n\n\nMeta-analysis of myeloid cell eQTLs.\nUse the myeloid cells from the BigBrain project.\nMany eQTLs colocalize with AD GWAS loci.\nHe wants to develop framework to understand enrichment for eQTL (and sQTL) data. - Approach 1: fine map and use results as continuous annotation, assess heritability via LD score regression. - Approach 2: run mediated expression score regression (MESC)."
