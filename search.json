Deep learning burden test\nRare variant association tests: - burden tests collase rare variants into gene scores. e.g. ARIEL, CAST, WSS Loses power when variant effects are in opposing directions, or many non-causal variants. - adaptive burden tests, use weights and thresholds. e.g. ADA, aSum, VT - dispersion tests, test variance of genetic effect, e.g. SKAT, C-alpha, SSU - combined tests, burden + dispersion tests combined, e.g. SKAT-O, Fisher, MIST - annotation-based tests, add annotations to existing methods, e.g. STAAR, RAVA-FIRST, FST\nFST. Coding variants - within start/end of genes defined by ensemble\nNC variants - Activity-by-contact (ABC) model predicts promoter and enhancer regions of genes.\nRare variants only – gnomAD AF < 0.05\nMap to annotations\nMap to ADSP individuals\nFunctional Score Test\nWhy is the Mahattan plot skewed? Do you have a p-value from null model?\nESM annotaton."
