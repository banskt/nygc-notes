    "text": "The Darwin\nUnit of evolution. Fold relative change in phenotype. The greater the time separating similar initial and final states, the slower the inferred rate of change. Although it is counter-intuitive at first, Gingerich (1983) gives two reasons as to why this could happen:\n\nOrganisms differing by a factor of much more (or less) than 1.2 are so different (or so similar) that they are rarely compared in calculating rates, regardless of the time available. (Meaning, high change rate over long time will be systematically ignored.)\nRates are based on net change between initial and final states. A period of rapid change followed by a period of stasis will yield a rate of intermediate value for the entire interval. Similarly, a period of rapid change in one direction followed by a period of reversal will yield a low net rate. The shorter the interval of measurement, the more likely one is to observe high rates. The longer the interval, the more stasis and evolutionary reversal are likely to be averaged in the result. This effect systematically damps the values of rates calculated over longer and longer intervals."

Using \\(F_{ST}\\) statistic, Coop provided quantitative formulation to understand the genetic divergence between two sub-population, for example, after migration.\n\n\n\nTo understand the effect of genetic drift of population structure, imagine a population of constant size of \\(N_e\\) diploid individuals that \\(T\\) generations in the past split into two sub-populations each of size \\(N_e\\) individuals, which do not subsequently exchange migrants. In the current day we sample an equal number of alleles from both subpopulations.\nConsider a pair of alleles sampled within one of our sub-populations and think about their per site heterozygosity.
