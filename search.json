    "text": "Welcome to my journal, where I keep track of my daily work and thoughts at the New York Genome Center. My primary goals in maintaining this journal are twofold: (1) to make my research reproducible and (2) to increase my productivity by avoiding repetition and sharing my work with colleagues.\nIn these pages, you will find an eclectic (sometimes erratic) mix of my research activities, including ideas, equations, code snippets, figures, and more. Thank you for joining me on this journey of discovery and exploration in genomics research. \nTo learn more about my work and research interests, please visit my main portfolio website."

    "text": "She is using functional annotation to improve finding rare variants which are associated with Alzheimer’s disease.\n\n\nTwo types of test:\n\nGene based RV association test.\nDeep learning burden test\n\nTypes of rare variant association tests:\n\nburden tests collase rare variants into gene scores. e.g. ARIEL, CAST, WSS Loses power when variant effects are in opposing directions, or many non-causal variants.\nadaptive burden tests, use weights and thresholds. e.g. ADA, aSum, VT\ndispersion tests, test variance of genetic effect, e.g. SKAT, C-alpha, SSU\ncombined tests, burden + dispersion tests combined, e.g. SKAT-O, Fisher, MIST\nannotation-based tests, add annotations to existing methods, e.g. STAAR, RAVA-FIRST, FST\n\nFuntional score test (FST) workflow:\n\nCoding variants, within start/end of genes defined by ensemble\nNC variants, Activity-by-contact (ABC) model predicts promoter and enhancer regions of genes.\nRare variants only – gnomAD AF < 0.05\nMap to annotations\nMap to ADSP individuals\n\nThings I did not understand:\n\nWhy is the Mahattan plot skewed?\nHow does the p-value distribution looks in null data?\n\nInteresting comments:\n\nJiayu mentioned about the ESM annotation from this paper: Language models enable zero-shot prediction of the effects of mutations on protein function by Meier, Rao, Verkuil, Liu, Sercu and Rives."
