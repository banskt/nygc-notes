  - What are the genes, cell-types and pathways that mediate disease progression?

Overview

  - Expression based stratification of critical care patients
  - Splicing and eQTLs

Sepsis

  - No reliable diagnostic marker
  - Current therapy includes antibiotics and organ support (no targeted treatments)
  - 150+ clinical trials
  - Substantial individual variance in response

**Genomic Advances in Sepsis (GAinS) study**

Established in 2005 - www.ukccggains.com

- Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP)
- Fecal Peritonitis (FP)

Data collected for each patient on days 1, 3, and/or 5 after ICU admission 

SepstratifieR: R package for SRS assignment and quantitative SRS score.
