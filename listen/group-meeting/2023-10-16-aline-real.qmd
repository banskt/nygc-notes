# The Big Brain Project

## Presentation by Aline Real

Gene expression and splicing from different parts of the brain.
Different brain tissues grouped in 6 major brain regions.
12,920 total samples.

How can we harmonize data from different projects,
different tissues and brain regions and sample prepped
in different ways to reduce possible biases and brain effects?
