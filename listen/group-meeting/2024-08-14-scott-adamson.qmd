High throughput methods for identifying and validating variant effects on splicing regulation.
Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRAs). 

### Framework for high-throughput identification. 

Aim 1. Hematological phenotype GWAS variants - coloc and ML predictions. 
Splicing relevant variants (sQTLs), SpliceAI high delta score, RNAprot high delta score. 

Aim 2. Assay effects on splicing. CRISPR base editing, scRNA-seq library construction,
hybrid capture of specific junctions and gRNAs, identification of splice-altering variants,
validation of splice-altering variants on isoforms with ONT and mass spectrometry.

### Prioritization of variants

sQTLs in 2953 clusters $\rightarrow$ 7122 genomic loci for 15 phenotypes (UKBB and BCX)
$\rightarrow$ coloc with blood traits. 

### CRISPR base editing



44 tissue-cohort pairs.
10887 samples for sQTL analysis. 
14 cohorts, ~29 tissues, 7 brain regions.
