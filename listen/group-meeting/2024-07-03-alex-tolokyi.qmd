## Presentation by Alex Tolokyi

The INTERVAL blood donor cohort, $n=~50000$
individuals sampled during blood donation across England.
Most have been genotyped. 
Few (~4000-5000) have RNA and proteins sequenced.
Further, ~40000 have 230 metabolites sequenced
(Nightingale Health). Metabolon HD4 (913 metabolites)
for ~10000 individuals.

eQTL and sQTL mapping, colocalization analysis and
mediation analysis are available in their RNA-Seq portal.

SpliceQTLs were annotated. They were more downstream (~5-10kb?) from TSS compared to eQTLs.
Trans-sQTLs discovered 754 trans-sSNP, 642 splice events and 208 target trans-sGenes.
For comparison, GTEx detects 29 trans-sQTLs only 2 of which are in whole blood.

Most trans-sQTL associations with the cis-eSNP for the RNA-binding splice factor QKI.

iGLUT cells and iGABA cells

Cis- and genome-wide heritability of transcript splicing.
