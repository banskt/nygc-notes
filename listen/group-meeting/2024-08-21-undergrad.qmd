# Molly Durawa

Worked with Megan. RNA Binding Proteins (RBPs).
Different isoforms of a given RBP may have different functions.
Broad goal: How alternative splicing of RBPs affect their downstream functions?

RBM10 is a splicing factor with multiple isoforms.
The isoforms are consistently expressed and differ in their functional domains.

# Jiayu Su

Spatial Isoform Statistical Modeling. (Splisosm).

Characterizing the spatial splicing landscape using Splisosm.

GLMM. Multinomial model. 
Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion. 
Spatial Variation (SV) and Differential Usage (DU) tests.
The HSIC-based DU test does not account for spatial randomness.
