## Presentation by Izzy Grabski

Framework to deconvolute drug targets using CRISPR perturbation screens.

Statistical framework:
  1. Estimate denoised perturbation effects from perturbation screen data.
  This can be confounded by cell cycle and other sources of baseline hetrogeneity.
  Multi-condition latent factor model. Non-targeting cells will have only baseline variation.
  Cells receiving perturbation will have an addition perturbation component.
  2. Deconvolve drug-treated cells in terms of these perturbation effects.
  Scale, sparsity and uncertainty. Analogous to fine-mapping in GWAS. Use SuSiE.
  3. Calibrate estimated probabilities within credible sets.
