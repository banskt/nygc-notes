Localizing AD polygenic signal using deep learning

GWAS of AD shows it is a polygenic disease.
Functional annotations aid in finding molecular features that best explain a polygenic trait.

Previously, people used DL delta scores to predict the functional effect of variants.

More than 50% of AD heritability is captured by SNPs which have cis-regulatory regions in microglia.
CRE elements $\rightarrow$ enhancers, promoters, open chromatin regions.
There is 10x enrichment of average heritability explained by these variants 
with respect to the global average.

DL delta scores from Enformer can be used as a prior probability in finemapping.
