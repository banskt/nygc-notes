# RNA binding proteins in alternate splicing

RBPs are important regulator of neurodevelopment.

Analyze ENCODE4 long-read data to identify isoform landscape of given dataset.
Perform function predictions on protein isoform sequences by looking at
localization, protein domains and disordered regions.
Zomm into isoform localization and experimentally validate our prediction.

Systematic study + resources for the community by providing a master table.
