## Correlated Traits and The Response of Multiple Traits to Selection

### Presented by Aline Real

Genetic variants in one trait influences multiple other traits through complex pathways.
Pleiotropy. Natural selection acts on multiple phenotypes simultaneously.

Breeder's equation for multiple traits:
$$
R_1 = V_{A, 1}\beta_1 + V_{A, 1, 2}\beta_2
$$

$$
R_2 = V_{A, 2}\beta_2 + V_{A, 1, 2}\beta_1
$$

$$
\mathbf{R} = \mathbf{G} \mathbf{V}_{\mathbf{P}}^{-1} \mathbf{S} = \mathbf{G}\mathbf{\beta}
$$
