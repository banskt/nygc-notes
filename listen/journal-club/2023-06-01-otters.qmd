# OTTERS: a powerful TWAS framework leveraging summary-level reference data

### Presented by Teresa Lin

Traditional TWAS works in three steps: (1) learn from eQTL data, 
(2) predict gene expression on GWAS data, (3) find association between predicted
gene expression and the trait.
The main idea of OTTERS is to perform step 1 with eQTL summary statistics.
They use difference PRS methods.

We develop a TWAS framework called OTTERS
(Omnibus Transcriptome Test using Expression Reference Summary data)
that adapts multiple polygenic risk score (PRS) methods
to estimate eQTL weights from summary-level eQTL reference data
and conducts an omnibus TWAS.
