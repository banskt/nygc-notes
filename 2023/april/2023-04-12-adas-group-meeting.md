Gene based RV association test. 
Deep learning burden test

Rare variant association tests:
 - burden tests collase rare variants into gene scores. e.g. ARIEL, CAST, WSS
 Loses power when variant effects are in opposing directions, or many non-causal variants.
 - adaptive burden tests, use weights and thresholds. e.g. ADA, aSum, VT
 - dispersion tests, test variance of genetic effect, e.g. SKAT, C-alpha, SSU
 - combined tests, burden + dispersion tests combined,  e.g. SKAT-O, Fisher, MIST
 - annotation-based tests, add annotations to existing methods, e.g. STAAR, RAVA-FIRST, FST

 FST.
 Coding variants - within start/end of genes defined by ensemble

 NC variants - 
 Activity-by-contact (ABC) model predicts promoter and enhancer regions of genes.

 Rare variants only -- gnomAD AF < 0.05
